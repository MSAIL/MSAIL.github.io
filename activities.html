<h2>Tutorial Series</h2>
<h3>Tuesdays @ 5:30pm in DOW 2166</h3>
<p>Each week, MSAIL holds seminars targeted at students lacking any formal training in Machine Learning or those wishing for a quick refresher on basic topics. These seminars are led by <strong>Aaron Pollack</strong> and <strong>Sam Tenka</strong>, and cover basic topics relating to the application of machine learning to data science problems. No theoretical familiarity with machine learning is required.  Always wondered what a support vector machine is? Want to know how to predict the chances of <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic">surviving the Titanic</a>?  This is the place for you. Check the calendar for the seminar schedule and the Github repo for the material we plan to cover!</p>

<h2>Hack Nights</h2>
<h3>Tuesdays @ 5:30pm in DOW 2166</h3>
<p>Bored of homework?  Tired of theory?  Itching to actually <em>implement something</em>?  Come to hack nights to solve data science challenges, try out new algorithm, or work on machine learning homework with friends!  This is a great place to collaborate with other MSAIL members!  This semester, <strong>Spencer Buja</strong> and <strong>Cheng-Yu Dai</strong> will be working through projects and exercises from <a href="http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/"><em>Artificial Intelligence:  A Modern Approach</em></a>, and <strong>Ben Bray</strong> will be implementing algorithms from papers covered in the reading group!</p>

<h2>MSAIL: General Meeting</h2>
<h3>Wednesday, 7:00pm in EECS 3433</h3>
<p>Learn more about what goes into making machines learn! Each week, a member presents a talk, tutorial or demonstration on a particular field related to machine learning. Usually, the topics for these talks are decided upto 2 weeks in advance and often include subfields that intersect with the presenter's current research or just coincide with their interests. In the past, we have had many members of Michigan's faculty come and deliver a presentation or engage in a discussion about their field of research (<a href="https://michiganross.umich.edu/faculty-research/faculty/eric-schwartz">Professor Eric Schwartz</a> for example, presented a very interesting talk on customer analytics). Normally, meetings consist of a 40-50 minute presentation by the speaker followed by a discussion of the material and Q&amp;A. Organized by <strong>Sam Tenka</strong> and <strong>Tejas Prahlad</strong>. </p>

<h2> MSAIL: Reading Group</h2>
<h3>Wednesday, 8:00pm in EECS 3433</h3>
<p>Read and discuss machine learning papers with other students from all across campus! We strive to help students understand topics in machine learning beyond the scope of an introductory course so this is perfect for those who love a deep dive into the field.  Our readings will usually be focused on research papers that are either fundamental in some way to the field of machine learning or that explore the deeper connections between seemingly disparate subfields. Together, we will all work hard to learn new material, drawing examples and applications from the experiences of our members. Meetings consist of a presentation/overview of the week's reading followed by a 30-40 minute group discussion about its underpinnings and possible applications. Organized by <strong>Sam Tenka</strong> and <strong>Tejas Prahlad</strong>. These meetings were not held this past semester but we hope to bring them back!</p>

<h2>Michigan Data Science Team</h2>
<h3>Thursday, 5:00pm in DOW 3725</h3>
<p>Work on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> competitions and more interestingly, amazing humanitarian <a href="https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/mdst-project/home?authuser=0">data science projects</a> with the first competitive university team in the country. Organized by <strong>Jonathan Stroud</strong> and advised by both <a href="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~jabernet/">Professor Jacob Abernethy</a> and Professor Eric Schwartz, students and researchers alike get to solve real world problems using data science (such as the <a href="http://www.mywater-flint.com/">Flint Water Crisis project</a>) as well as compete against professional data scientists from around the world in fun prediction challenges. You will read papers to learn cutting-edge ML techniques used to solve problems in domains outside of Computer Science, while collaborating with others doing the same and learning a lot along the way! Visit the Michigan Data Science Team (MDST) at <a href="http://mdst.eecs.umich.edu/">mdst.eecs.umich.edu</a> for more information. You can find meeting times either there, or on our <a href="http://mdst.eecs.umich.edu/calendar/">schedule page</a>.</p>
