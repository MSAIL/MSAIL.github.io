This means that around 700 million people are living on less than $1.90 a day (1). And while $1.90 is the standard set by the World Bank defining the international poverty line (2), by no means does it imply that a person earning more than this amount has anywhere near suitable standards of living. Poorer populations in countries such as South Sudan, Bolivia, and India (2) still struggle to access basic features that are usually taken for granted in more developed countries, such as clean water, sanitation, education, and healthcare. 2.1 billion people in the world do not have access to safe drinking water (3). Around 1.8 billion people do not have access to adequate sanitation (4). And a report from the World Health Organization and the World Bank found that 400 million do not have access to essential health services (5).\nMuch work is already being undertaken in attempts to address these key issues, but more is still needed. Artificial intelligence (AI) is one such area where there is potential in alleviating some of the problems accompanying poverty. AI encompasses areas such as natural language processing and robotics, and has seen success in recent years with technology like autonomous vehicles, disease diagnosis, and recommendation algorithms. It is a powerful tool that also has the potential to be applied in ways beneficial to those dealing with the circumstances and living standards that typically go with poverty, especially in the realms of sanitation and education.\nSanitation Issues of sanitation for impoverished regions encompass topics such as lack of clean water, proper toilet systems, and waste management.\nOne initiative attempting to address the problem of unsafe drinking water comes from an organization called Clean Water AI. Developers created a device that uses a “deep learning neural network to detect dangerous bacteria and harmful particles in water” (6). This technology employs computer vision to continuously monitor water quality and observe at a microscopic level. Widespread adoption of such an application could be beneficial for avoiding illnesses that arise from consumption of unsafe drinking water, such as cholera, typhoid, and polio (11).\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a short video detailing what Clean Water AI does:   Lack of proper waste management is another huge issue for underdeveloped regions. Without systems in place to take care of waste, it has become common for garbage to be thrown out in the surrounding areas or tossed into nearby water sources, where it sometimes becomes a playground for the neighboring children (7). While the establishment and utilization of governmental systems and resources could help manage this waste problem, there are also innovations in the AI sector that could be applied to target the problem. Recycling is an important process for these communities, and a robot designed by engineers from Simon Fraser University could help distinguish waste from recyclable materials (8). Growing company CleanRobotics is also taking steps to aid the waste management process with an autonomous system called TrashBot, which uses “robotics, computer vision and artificial intelligence to detect and separate landfill from recyclables” (12). Establishing automated systems for removing trash build-up could make the process easier in underdeveloped regions that lack the proper systems, and this could be crucial for lowering rates of disease caused by unhygienic environments. Such use of artificial intelligence could also potentially improve financial outlooks for the citizens in these areas through reuse and repurposing of recyclable materials.\n Credit: Arvinder Singh  Education The standard of education and the availability of educational resources also suffer in impoverished regions. Improved educational resources correlates positively with poverty statistics, as better education can benefit a region overall and positively impact its economy; “Education promotes economic growth because it provides skills that increase employment opportunities and income” (13)(14). It is no surprise, then, that poorer regions have less access to proper education and fewer members of the community acquire an education. Lack of nearby schools, teachers, transportation, and time are all contributors to this problem.\nUniversal education is a popular initiative and there is work being done with the AI field to progress this goal. The rise of the internet has provided opportunities for bringing education into the home with the growing format of online schooling. Having the capability to view pre-taught lessons online is an important development in tackling the aforementioned impediments to education in underdeveloped regions. While there already exist many online resources that provide information on a variety of subjects for anyone to browse, language barriers still persist. The Presentation Translator from Microsoft is one such tool involving AI that is attempting to address language barriers (15). It uses speech recognition and translation to create subtitles of presentations in the desired language, which users can access through the tool’s affiliated app or browser. Google’s translation application can also be used for reading, writing, and speaking translations. There are many other recent developments in the field of natural language processing that can help tackle language barriers, and further expansion of available languages in these applications would be advantageous for poorer regions with lesser-known tongues.\n Credit: Arvinder Singh  Challenges to AI Access There is much more growth happening in the AI field than what has been discussed here, and these technological advancements may be useful for targeting the persisting problems of poverty. But a major obstacle of using these tools to benefit developing countries is that many of these regions do not have the necessary structures in place to even implement such technologies.\nIf specialists are needed for the establishment and maintenance of these AI applications, it is unlikely there will be someone in these areas who can fulfill that role, especially with the lack of access to education. It could become even more costly to hire outside help for maintaining these applications than it already is just to instate them. It must also be determined who will fund these tools – if the creators of these applications are not providing them for free, who will the responsibility fall upon for payment? The impoverished region presumably cannot bear that burden. Governmental assistance is often what is needed in these situations, but these are developing areas and governmental instability is a common feature, as well as the fact that the developing economy often does not yet supply the financial resources needed to establish such systems. Lack of internet access is another deterrent to providing these AI tools. When the poorer regions of Asia and Africa are the ones more likely to have fewer people using the internet (16), and less than 5% of people are online in the poorest countries (10), this creates difficulty in making use of resources such as online education.\nSome initiatives seeking to resolve these obstacles are in the works, but they encounter their own obstacles in the sheer size of the issue and lack of financial resources (like Project Loon, which was attempting to provide worldwide internet access through essential parts of cell towers attached to balloons (10) but has since shut down in January of 2021, stating they “haven’t found a way to get the costs low enough to build a long-term, sustainable business” (17)). The barriers to technological access in underdeveloped areas are widespread and persistent, and it is difficult for one well-meaning company or organization to solve them. These significant concerns will need to be addressed if artificial intelligence is to play a role in reducing poverty in our world.\nReferences [1]: World Poverty Statistics via lifewater.org\n[2]: World Bank\n[3]: Water Access Data\n[4]: CDC Wash Statistics\n[5]: New report shows that 400 million do not have access to essential health services via WHO\n[6]: Clean Water AI\n[7]: via PBS\n[8]: Artificial intelligence robot reduces waste contamination at SFU\n[9]: Flight systems via Loon\n[10]: Internet Access\n[11]: Contaminated water can transmit diseases\n[12]: TrashBot via CleanRobotics\n[13]: Poverty Education Statistics\n[14]: Millions could escape poverty by finishing secondary education\n[15]: Microsoft Presentation Translator\n[16]: Internet access growing worldwide but remains higher in advanced economies via Pew Research\n[17]: Loon for all\n","date":1615680000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1615680000,"objectID":"bed14115cf0946c7093ba6a2b273332e","permalink":"https://MSAIL.github.io/post/developing_countries/","publishdate":"2021-03-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/developing_countries/","section":"post","summary":"10% of the world’s population lives in extreme poverty.

Organising volunteers for beach cleanups. Encouraging people to lead greener lifestyles. These are just some of the traditional methods that have been used to protect our environment. But, as Alan Turing once said, \u0026lsquo;At some stage,\u0026hellip; we should have to expect the machines to take control\u0026rsquo; [1] and this couldn’t be more true in these conservation efforts. Be it preserving wildlife, cleaning up the environment or reducing green-house gas emissions, AI has started playing an increasingly dominant role as it has become good at numerous tasks such as visually identifying and tracking poachers or designing the most energy efficient buildings.\nGoogle, for example, has used AI to increase the efficiency and significantly reduce the carbon footprint of its data centers. Data centers are massive energy consumers, being turned on 24/7 and requiring significant cooling. In 2016 it was reported that data centers used more electricity than Britain, producing roughly the same carbon footprint as the aviation industry [2]. A google search of the video \u0026ldquo;Despacito\u0026rdquo; activates six to eight of Google\u0026rsquo;s data centers [3]. In line with Google’s effort to stay carbon neutral (which they achieved in 2007 [3]), Google implemented a reinforcement learning algorithm in 2016 to determine what “cooling configurations (in its data centers) would reduce energy consumption” [5]. A reinforcement algorithm is a subset of machine learning in which the environment sends a ‘state’ and ‘reward’ to the ‘agent’ - the reinforcement learning algorithm - which in turn tries to maximise the reward [4]. The data centers using this reinforcement algorithm now consistently use 30% less energy than expected [6].\nA Google data center in Iowa (MIT Technology Review) Big companies are not the only ones that are taking advantage of AI to be more environmentally friendly. Small startups are using AI to tackle environmental problems as well. In a remote reserve in Ecuador, Topher White - founder of Rainforest connection (a startup that aims to combat deforestation) - climbs a tree using a small harness and installs a small box containing an old cell phone and solar cells [7]. These phones recoprd the natural rainforest sounds and use AI to detect logging noises, upon which a notification is sent to a ranger. He had started his firm after learning of the severity of deforestation: the number of trees has fallen by almost 50% since the beginning of human civilisation, and still over 15 billion trees are currently cut down every year [8]. Topher White\u0026rsquo;s first encounter with deforestation came ironically when he was on a trip to the rainforests of Borneo and was shocked to find illegal loggers just a hundred meters from the ranger station. Monitoring forests using AI to identify deforestation on satellite imagery often comes too late as satellite imagery requires some amount of deforestation before it becomes visible. However, the sound, he recalls, was deafening, which gave him the idea to mount these small phones on the treetops to identify logging. The very next day after the first installation, a logger was apprehended, and it is now preventing deforestation in 10 countries [7].\nTopher White (Rolex/Stefan Walter via FastCompany) In fact even industries have turned to using AI to reduce costs and also increase their sustainability. One example is in Norway, where AI is being used to increase the efficiency of salmon farms [9]. Telenor Research - the research wing of the Norwegian telecoms company Telenor that is conducting research on the use of AI in fish farms - has come up with a neural network that uses a video feed from underwater cameras to determine when the salmon have finished feeding. The salmon swim in schools which disperse when food is thrown, but when the salmon are full, there are tiny deviations in this behaviour which the neural network picks up with 80% accuracy. Identifying these cues to better feed the right amount of food is beneficial economically (40% of the cost of salmon farms comes from fish food), and also helps prevent low oxygen levels, algae blooms and high nitrate levels which are toxic to fish, among other problems [12].\nThere are numerous other AI applications in this area: IBM has come up with a machine learning tool named AquaCloud to predict lice outbreaks in Salmon with 70% accuracy using a random forest algorithm [10]. The industries' increasingly intensive salmon and rainbow trout fishing encourages lice growth, which in turn makes them unsellable because lice feed on salmon skin [9].\nThe results of AquaCloud: the green line shows the lice outbreak predicted two weeks in advance. (NCE Seafood Innovation Center) The use of AI on fish farms is especially beneficial as fish farms are sustainable and help to reduce the dependency on precious ocean fish populations. Wild salmon are being depleted at an alarming rate, yet Norway’s salmon exports are only rising. Even here, AI is also being used to track the wild salmon population in efforts to sustain its population [9].\nThese examples are but a small subset of AI-related projects that have been done. A brief search of new competitions regarding environmental solutions (most of which use AI, even if the competition implies only a possible technological solution), confirms the increasing interest in sustainability. The Xprize - a nonprofit that runs public competitions - is currently running a $10 million prize rainforest competition to “develop novel technologies to rapidly and comprehensively survey rainforest biodiversity and use that data to improve our understanding of this complex ecosystem” [11]. Microsoft’s AI for Good grants are given to projects that enhance climate, water, and biodiversity. Prince William recently launched the Earthshot prize - a series of annual one million pound prize competitions in five categories such as reviving the oceans, cleaning the air, and protecting nature. There are countless other competitions and the examples discussed in this article are just a taste of the AI environmental projects to come.\nReferences [1]: Ten Famous Quotes about Artificial Intelligence\n[2]: Why Data Centres are the New Frontier in the Fight Against Climate Change\n[3]: The Internet Cloud has a Dirty Secret\n[4]: Introduction to Various Reinforcement Learning Algorithms\n[5]: Google Just Gave Control Over Data Center Cooling to an AI\n[6]: Google 2019 Environmental Report\n[7]: This Network of Microphones Listens for the Chainsaws of Illegal Loggers in the Rainforest\n[8]: Crowther et al., Mapping tree density at a global scale\n[9]: AI Could Help Find Cheaper and Smarter Ways to Raise Fish\n[10]: The Seafood Innovation Cluster\n[11]: Rainforest XPrize\n[12]: Why overfeeding fish is a problem and how to avoid it\n","date":1613952000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613952000,"objectID":"af6501b9bf4c0c790d3fb7f661b156ca","permalink":"https://MSAIL.github.io/post/ai_environment/","publishdate":"2021-02-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/ai_environment/","section":"post","summary":"Employing forest guards to protect endangered species.

Many professors push their PhD students to give talks. Giving these talks helps researchers build the ability to read and understand papers quickly, and the ability to communicate findings effectively.\n Volunteer or be volunTOLD.\n— Prof. David Fouhey\n Dr. Fouhey told this joke multiple times during the computer vision reading group last semester and the other professors agreed. It succinctly summarizes the emphasis placed on giving these talks.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s a reading group? Reading groups regularly meet to discuss topics in research. Most of the time, the group will focus on one specific paper detailing an important finding. In AI, many of these reading groups may be focused on award-winning papers from recent conferences or on methods relevant to the participants' research.\nReading groups exist mainly to enrich the participants' knowledge. Sometimes the talks will focus on a broader topic as an introduction and sometimes the talks will focus on a specific method in a specific paper. The more niche the audience of the reading group, the more advanced the topic tends to be. At MSAIL, we try to strike a balance between our younger, less-experienced audience (i.e. underclassmen) and our older, experienced audience (upperclassmen, graduate students, etc.).\nChoosing a topic Choosing a topic may be the hardest part of the presentation process. Generally, you can present any topic you want, given that it hasn\u0026rsquo;t already been presented recently. Present on something that grabs your interest immediately, or something you have some familiarity with - it\u0026rsquo;ll make the preparation process more bearable. If you\u0026rsquo;re open to topics and are confident you can adapt, then just go to a conference or journal page and search through some of the accepted papers that catch your eye (at the time of writing, I\u0026rsquo;ve been looking at ICLR 2021 papers).\nIn my opinion, the main question you should ask yourself when you\u0026rsquo;ve identified a potential topic is:\n Am I willing to read about this topic in depth, even to the extent of falling into a rabbit hole?\n You obviously don\u0026rsquo;t need to know everything about the topic you choose (no one does), but persistence is the key to having a strong presentation. The more comfy you are with the overall subject area, the more natural your presentation will flow and the less likely you are to trip up. (For MSAIL, however, if you\u0026rsquo;re a newcomer and haven\u0026rsquo;t really done a reading group presentation before, we\u0026rsquo;ll help you out!)\nHere are some questions you should ask yourself when looking at a paper or topic that you\u0026rsquo;re about to choose:\n Why is the topic important? What do I hope to get out of it?  If it\u0026rsquo;s not clearly important or you don\u0026rsquo;t gain anything from knowledge of the topic itself, you\u0026rsquo;ll just be wasting time.   Is this interesting to the naked eye?  Important for getting people to attend your talk, and also helpful in gauging whether your audience will stay engaged. If they aren\u0026rsquo;t engaged in the beginning how can they be expected to in the end?   Can I learn about this topic within a reasonable amount of time?  A \u0026ldquo;reasonable amount of time\u0026rdquo; is generally a week or so. You need to choose papers of reasonable length. We often suggest presenting on conference papers because they\u0026rsquo;re less than 10 pages on average. Longer papers and topics are more feasible down the line when you\u0026rsquo;ve become comfortable with these types of presentations.    For the examples in this post, I will go through the process of choosing a topic for one of my previous talks. I\u0026rsquo;ve given plenty of talks on uninteresting topics and papers, but some were received particularly well. I will talk about my process for presenting VideoBERT, which I presented way back in Fall 2019. This was actually my first ever MSAIL talk, and at the time I had only recently become acquainted with AI research. The talk had plenty of faults, which I\u0026rsquo;ll try to use as examples.\n The central flow diagram from the VideoBERT paper by Sun et al.  Reading relevant sources For a specific paper Even if you choose one paper, that paper is probably not the only source you\u0026rsquo;re looking at to understand all the content. When you first read through the paper itself, you should annotate the key points (this is just a common reading skill, but it\u0026rsquo;s easy to forget!) and note the portions that confuse you. Depending on your background, you may or may not be able to finish the first pass. You should aim to have a big picture understanding of the paper, so maybe about 30%. If you can\u0026rsquo;t reach that level on your first read - don\u0026rsquo;t fret. You need to go read some supplementary materials. In particular, any decent paper will reference prior/related work in a section near the introduction - this is where you can dive into their citations and read up on the things that confuse you. Alternatively, I\u0026rsquo;ve found that Medium posts are particularly helpful as well for understanding more basic content.\n  Related Work section in VideoBERT paper.   Note the underlined portions here from the Related Work section of the VideoBERT paper. These highlight topics that might be worth searching up. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to dive into everything, but having a general understanding of what cross-modal learning and BERT are would help to better understand this paper.\nIf after all that, you still can\u0026rsquo;t understand 30% of the material in the paper, then I\u0026rsquo;m afraid you probably need to read further on basic material and possibly postpone your talk. I don\u0026rsquo;t expect this to happen because the pool of people who choose to present is self-selecting (as in, you\u0026rsquo;re more likely to want to present in a reading group if you already have basic background), but just in case, don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to start at the beginning. I too have had to withdraw after signing up for a reading group before because I just did not understand what I was reading at all.\nAfter the first pass, you have an idea of what the paper\u0026rsquo;s central ideas are. You can then start outlining what you want to talk about. Any subsequent passes will simply be to reinforce your understanding of the paper.\nFor a broader topic For a broader topic, you should still choose to focus on a few papers in order to narrow the scope of your presentation. If you choose this, you likely have an idea in mind for how you wish to synthesize the ideas in the papers. Knowing this, you should focus your reading based on which points you hope to elucidate most. The process will very much feel like the process in the above section, except you\u0026rsquo;ll spend less time focusing on the intricate details of any one paper and you\u0026rsquo;ll focus more on the key ideas that you can use to build toward whatever main idea you\u0026rsquo;re focusing on.\nIn general, giving these types of talks is difficult. Even professors struggle to present so much content in a clear way. If you intend to give a talk like this, make sure to spend extra time in advance to really nail a cohesive argument. Otherwise, just stick to one paper since usually the time you have is only enough for one.\nAn example of a decent talk that synthesizes ideas in multiple papers is Justin Johnson\u0026rsquo;s lecture on Object Segmentation. This is obviously not a reading group talk and is an entire course lecture - but the principles are relatively similar since the topics presented here are from recent papers. Another good example is the talk Dr. Chai gave us in Fall 2020.\nSome of our own, more tame talks presenting multiple papers include John Day\u0026rsquo;s Brain-Inspired AI talk, Yash Gambhir\u0026rsquo;s Text Summarization talk, and my talk on using reinforcement learning for optimization in COVID-19 problems. If you watch them you\u0026rsquo;ll notice some of the difficulties we had with balancing our content and finishing in time.\nCreating slides Most of the time you\u0026rsquo;ll be preparing slides to assist you in your talk. Organizing your slides properly is the key to getting a good presentation going.\nSomething that helps me is using a general slide outline and then identifying where in the paper I can get the information for a specific section. Then I fill in the sections and occasionally add subsections based on the subtitles in the paper.\nIn general, you want to introduce the following points in any regular paper presentation. You can change the order to suit your preferred flow, but the one presented here works well normally. Note that you can use any number of slides for each section:\n Motivation  Why did the authors explore this topic? Who and how does it help solve a big problem?   Major Contributions  What are the authors proposing or introducing? Make this clear at the beginning. Then your audience will know what to expect.   Background  What does your audience need to know (at a high level) before you dive into the details of the topic? This is not always necessary, but if you\u0026rsquo;re presenting something technically challenging you may want to briefly introduce this.   Method/Theory  This is the novel part of the paper. What did the authors do and how did they do it?   Results/Experiments  How did they validate their methods and what did they compare it to? What are the deliverables?   Discussion/Takeaways/Future Work  Restate the major contributions. Also, talk about the implications for the future.    General Principles You\u0026rsquo;ve probably presented to someone before. In that case, you should be well aware of standard principles, but I\u0026rsquo;ll write some in case you aren\u0026rsquo;t:\n Low amount of text on any one slide  This is a technical talk. Please don\u0026rsquo;t make your readers lose you. Personally, I tend to put around 2 lines of text on a slide and then explain the rest verbally. Putting less text and explaining it instead helps me better understand the content too!   Tables, images, diagrams, and videos wherever possible  I don\u0026rsquo;t need to tell you that a picture is worth a thousand words, but they\u0026rsquo;ll help a ton. You can usually just steal these from the paper and its supplementary materials. If they don\u0026rsquo;t have any and you feel that one would be appropriate, don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to create one!   Avoid equations when you can  Sometimes the talk is devoted to an equation or the theory you\u0026rsquo;re discussing is heavily reliant on equations (I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine some reinforcement learning papers without Bellman\u0026rsquo;s equation.). But if the paper has a lot of equations, try only to include the most important ones.    Take a look at my VideoBERT slides and note that I absolutely did not follow these principles and the above listed structure during that talk. I consider my VideoBERT talk to be of poor quality. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about the technical content. (Note that this link is Michigan only)\n Here are a few sample slides depicting how I would\u0026rsquo;ve roughly modified my VideoBERT talk to be easier to follow and listen to. I only wrote up to the methods section, because I just wanted to depict some of the principles in action. Again, don\u0026rsquo;t worry about the technical content. (This link is open to everyone)\nAlso, feel free to take a look at this slidedeck for general tips.\nPresenting your slides Presentation is very important for a technical talk. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure most presenters don\u0026rsquo;t want to bore their audience. During one reading group a while ago, I delivered a one hour talk that included even professors in the audience. After that talk I didn\u0026rsquo;t receive a single question. I can only speculate whether they got lost, whether we were out of time, or whether I just completely bored them. Let\u0026rsquo;s hope that doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen to you.\nHere are some steps you can take to reduce the chance of losing your audience:\n Reiterating the importance of preparing your slides properly. Prepare them as if you were presenting them, and then practice presenting them at least once before your talk. This is a given - you should be speaking and never reading. Don\u0026rsquo;t go on diversions. Save them till the end. Leave room for questions during your presentation. I doubt most people will remember their questions by the end. A good rule might be to ask for questions every 5 minutes. Similarly, you should be gauging understanding as you go along. If the audience can attest to understand what you\u0026rsquo;re saying, you\u0026rsquo;re fine. Speak slowly. I don\u0026rsquo;t know about you, but I\u0026rsquo;d rather have my entire audience understand 80% of my presentation and not finish within time than finishing and not having anyone understand anything. I sometimes break this rule without realizing.  There are probably many more principles to follow, but in reading groups these are the ones I\u0026rsquo;ve found to be the most blatant errors that I wish I corrected.\nCan I forgo preparing slides? If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to prepare slides, you can either:\n Walk through the paper itself Prepare questions and facilitate a discussion rather than giving a talk  I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t advise a newcomer (or anyone, for that matter) to choose the first option. The point of preparing slides is to make material more presentable and to help you, the presenter, understand the paper better. I\u0026rsquo;ve only experienced people presenting straight from the paper when they knew what they were talking about but had last minute obligations come up. For reference, the last two times I saw this done were from a student who wrote the paper he was presenting on, and from a senior research scientist at Google Brain. It is generally okay, however, to supplement your slides during your talk by briefly visiting the paper to discuss something like a figure or a table, or to answer questions.\nThe second option is far more feasible, and at MSAIL we actually recommend this format. Discussion questions help the audience engage with the material more. However, good discussions usually occur around people with background, so be wary of your audience. You\u0026rsquo;ll usually be presenting something in addition to the questions - for example, last Winter we had a discussion about using vision to analyze CT scans for the purpose of detecting COVID-19. All we did was play a video prepared by another organization and then discussed it in detail. This is perfectly fine, given that you have an interesting topic.\nGoing forward Yeah, preparing to present at a reading group is a lot of work the first time around. After a while, you\u0026rsquo;ll be comfortable enough with both approaching novel technical content and with your presentation skills, so you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to take shortcuts and structure things as you wish. You\u0026rsquo;ll also just become faster. In the long term, this skill will certainly help you as a researcher.\nGone are the days when the MSAIL Admin team was scrambling to prepare entire talks within 5 hours on the day of (we were quite notorious for this during the \u0026lsquo;19-\u0026lsquo;20 school year). This happened because we had very few speakers, but we\u0026rsquo;re much better off now. I hope you never prepare a talk within such a constraint because I can guarantee that the talk will fail miserably. The further along you go as a researcher, the later you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to start preparing reading group presentations, but you\u0026rsquo;ll still wish you started earlier.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re ready to try your hand at a talk, sign up with your reading group(s).

So you get a dataset of driver-view video that you recently collected, hand it off to your labelers, and a month or so later train the model on the labeled data. You get about 90% accuracy on both your train and test sets, and so you push the code to your team’s GitHub, tell your team you have a working algorithm, and celebrate. When the team uses it, however, they make an unpleasant discovery: the algorithm does not detect sidewalks at all! Your troubleshooting brings you to that labeled dataset, and you hang your head in your hands: 90% of the frames in the dataset don’t have sidewalks in them! Instead of learning meaningful decision-making rules, your model has learned to predict that all images do not contain sidewalks.\n Or let’s say you’re working at a security company, and your team is tasked with creating a facial recognition algorithm. You spend a few months labeling a dataset of human faces, where the distribution of ethnicities in the dataset matches the distribution of ethnicities in the United States. According to the US Census from 2010, the dataset will be roughly 75% “white alone” faces and 13% “black or African American” faces (as seen in [1], Tab. P3). Then you tuck the dataset away into some folder somewhere and move on to designing the algorithm. When it comes to test time, your algorithm does significantly worse at recognizing dark-skinned faces. This reflects findings from a paper published in 2018 by Buolamwini and Gebru [2], where three commercial facial recognition algorithms trained on two benchmark datasets consisting of roughly 80% / 85% “white” faces had an astonishing 35% error rate on dark-skinned female faces. The consequences of an algorithm biased like this are not theory; less than an hour away from Ann Arbor, a dark-skinned man in Farmington Hills was wrongfully arrested based on a mistake made by a facial recognition algorithm, forcing him to spend thousands of dollars on an attorney to defend himself for a crime he did not commit [3].\nObama being upsampled into a light-skinned man (The Verge)  In either case, you have a critical failure, and your project manager firmly tells you that the product needs to ship in three weeks. One possible solution is to add more data to “balance out” the different image classes: have your labelers find and label more images with sidewalks, or have them find and label more images of people of color. But labeling the original dataset took months, and with the degree of imbalance that you have, it would take a similar amount of resources to successfully address that. And you only have three weeks! Even if you had more time, how do you tell your boss that you now need the team to spend more resources on more labeling work? If only there was a way that you could have balanced the dataset earlier!\n Both of these are motivating examples for the problem I am working on in my lab, the Data Elements from Video using Impartial Algorithm Tools for Extraction lab at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI-DEVIATE). This is a subproblem we are trying to solve as part of our broader objective to create tools for the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to assist labelers with video data. Specifically in this subproblem, we want to save FHWA labelers time with future research tasks, and we want the models they train to avoid bias. We call this problem the “human sampling problem”.\n Labeling lots of data is costly. Hiring labelers requires money, and those labelers need time to accurately label a dataset. When it comes to a non-trivial image / video labeling task (for example, drawing bounding boxes around cell phones in videos of someone driving a vehicle), you also need to create a rubric so that all of your labelers are on the same page.\n In addition, you may not want to use all that data. If a large dataset is skewed, an algorithm trained on that dataset will in turn be skewed towards making a particular decision. This is the root of both of the failures in the examples presented above – a sidewalk detector trained on skewed data cannot recognize sidewalks, and a facial recognition algorithm trained on skewed data struggles to identify the faces of dark-skinned women.\n Considering both of these problems, one possible remedy would be to sample a subset of your original dataset before handing it over to the labelers such that the subset we select is as informative as possible. We hypothesize that a subset with maximum information will not be skewed, i.e. we think a dataset of 10 cats and 90 dogs will probably have less information than a dataset with 50 cats and 50 dogs. The way we have framed this is that we want to maximize gain in information per unit of cost in terms of labeler time.\n In short, we want to reduce labeling time as much as possible while minimizing loss in accuracy by sampling a subset of our dataset that contains as much information as possible.\n At this point, we are still investigating possible solutions. We are currently testing our ideas on images, with plans to transfer our work to applications on video data. Here’s what we’ve already done and what we’re working on right now:\nSanity checks: We first confirmed that skewed datasets tend to have lower accuracy. Using the Stanford Cars and the FGCV-Aircraft datasets, we looked at samples of 50 of one class versus 150 of the other and compared the results of a model trained on those samples to a model trained on 100 of each. We confirmed that the model trained on the balanced sample tended to outperform the model trained on the skewed samples.\nSome examples from the Stanford Cars dataset  The rest of our techniques essentially attempt to learn some representation of each example image in our dataset, then find a sampling strategy such that the examples we sample into our subset are as dissimilar as possible.\nSSD: We tried using SSD (sum of square differences) as a distance between every pair of images in our dataset and sampling a subset that maximizes the sum of SSDs between images in the dataset. We did not find a correlation between sum of SSDs in a dataset and model accuracy, because SSD does not encode relevant information. Moreover, we would have to solve an NP-hard problem to accurately maximize the sum of SSDs in a sampled subset, making this strategy unviable on large datasets.\nKeypoint/descriptors-based methods: Algorithms like SIFT, SURF, and ORB detect some number of keypoints that describe an image, along with descriptors for each of those keypoints. We first tried getting a single value for each sample image by summing the squared sums of descriptor components, but this did not produce correlations because we lost the spatial information from the keypoints. We are currently using k-means clustering to separate example images into k different image classes determined via unsupervised learning.\nThe scale-invariant feature transform  (SIFT) algorithm in action Edge detection: Edges can imply what content is in an image, and a dataset whose images have varying amounts of horizontal and vertical edges may have more information than a dataset whose images’ horizontal and vertical edges are not as varied. We are currently investigating ways to implement and evaluate this idea.\nUnsupervised feature encoding with neural networks: By having a neural network (possibly sequence model, GAN) attempt to perform a task, it will learn the features of the data it attempts to perform that task on; we can use those learned features to describe our examples. This is likely appropriate to our problem, but we have not started investigating this yet. I personally think that this approach has merit simply because of how much recent work there has been on this subject, but I wonder if using a learning algorithm to address a problem with a learning algorithm may recurse the problem back into the solution.\n For DEVIATE, successfully solving the human sampling problem means we’ll have found a way to reduce labeler workload while also mitigating problems with accuracy and bias that accompany skewed datasets. Our hope is that creating such a tool will let organizations train more effective models with fewer resources, allowing them to invest effort elsewhere in their projects.\n If working on this problem interests you, consider following up with me (musicer@umich.edu) or the advisor for the subteam working on this problem, Dr. Carol Flannagan (cacf@umich.edu).\nCitations: [1]\tU.S. Government, “2010 Census Summary File 1,” U.S. Census Bureau, United States, SF1/10-4 RV, 2010.\n[2] J.

Much of this performance gain has been attributed to two trends in the NLP community, namely the introduction of transformers, and the increase in model size (and consequent need for intense computational power). Capitalizing on these trends, OpenAI recently released a transformer-based model called GPT-3 with 175 billion parameters, that was trained on roughly 500 billion tokens scraped from the internet. This MSAIL discussion focused predominantly on three questions addressed in the paper:\n Does a substantial increase in model size actually lead to better performance in downstream tasks? Can language models effectively model intelligent and adaptable thought? What are the biases and risks associated with training a language model on the entire internet?  Sean also covered the transformer and GPT-3 model architectures, though the focus of the discussion was not on this aspect of the paper.\n You can find the recording of this talk here.\nSupplemental Resources Papers:\nLanguage Models are Few-Shot Learners (Brown et al.)\nArticles:\nThe Illustrated Transformer\nThe Illustrated GPT-2\n","date":1600207200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600207200,"objectID":"7b271409ec365353689a1f93fd5c9aca","permalink":"https://MSAIL.github.io/talk/gpt3_091520/","publishdate":"2020-09-09T22:35:38-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/gpt3_091520/","section":"talk","summary":"Speaker(s): Sean Stapleton","tags":["GPT-3","Natural Language Processing","Transformers","Language Models","BERT","OpenAI"],"title":"The Trend Towards Large Language Models","type":"talk"},{"authors":["MSAIL"],"categories":null,"content":"Speaker(s): Daniel Preotiuc-Pietro and Mayank Kulkarni\nTopic: Applied Named Entity Recognition\nDuring this talk, two senior research scientists from Bloomberg\u0026rsquo;s AI Group presented on some of their work on Applied Named Entity Recognition.

Indeed. MSAIL will maintain a list of Members, defined as participants in at least one major communications channels such as Slack or a mailing list. MSAIL will strive to discuss Machine Learning literature regularly throughout each school year. Upon joining the organization, all members agree not to undermine the purpose or mission of MSAIL. It falls to the Cosine to execute this Article. Article 1: Legislative powers lie in the Sines. The body of Sines possesses complete power: a simple majority of Sines will suffice to amend this Constitution, to appoint a Cosine, to override any decision of the Cosine, or to act in place of the Cosine. Sines who are informed of a decision to be made but offer no prompt response are not counted in the denominator of the \"simple majority\". The Sines will not allow the number of Cosines to fall below 1. By default, the Sines lie dormant and all powers and responsibilities lie with the Cosine. Article 2: Executive powers lie in the Cosine. Specifically, the Cosine is responsible for the day-to-day functioning of MSAIL, and to that end may act and delegate arbitrarily within Constitutional bounds. It is traditional for the Cosine to distribute significant short-term tasks among the Sines. The Cosine will report to the Sines, and the Sines will vote promptly on presented issues. The Cosine may appoint new Sines with the advice and consent of the old Sines. The Cosine will not allow the number of Sines to fall below 3. The Cosine shall break ties among the Sines. The Cosine may be a Sine. Article 3: MSAIL may also have Faculty Mentors. A faculty mentor can help us just by association. MSAIL may mention their names on its official communications. MSAIL shall inform each Faculty Mentor of its activities via brief weekly emails with no reply needed. Faculty mentors can point us to literature. Faculty mentors are always welcome to share cool papers. MSAIL may also request recommendations within a specific topic. A Faculty Mentor need not take on additional responsibilities, but may choose to do so if requested. The Sines and Cosine will endeavor to use Faculty Mentors’ time effectively. Faculty Mentors need not make any administrative decisions. Faculty Mentors are always welcome but never obliged to attend MSAIL meetings. Article 4: MSAIL is committed to inclusivity and transparency. MSAIL will not discriminate based on academic affiliation(s) or lack thereof, age, breastfeeding or lack thereof, career status, color, criminal record, disability or lack thereof, ethnicity, employment status, gender expression, gender identity, HIV status, marital status, national origin, parental status, personal association, physical features such as height and weight, political activity, pregnancy or lack thereof, race, religion or lack thereof, sex, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background, or veteran status. MSAIL will, moreover, actively include members, no matter the properties listed above. The creation and maintenance of an inclusive environment touches all aspects of our activities, from communications to recruitment and from discussion topics to leadership positions. MSAIL’s motto will be \"the more, the merrier\"; a corollary is that information such as planning discussions will be available to all members, so long as it does not conflict with privacy concerns. To rephrase a subset of the above in a university-required formula: MSAIL is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for all persons and does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, age, marital status, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, disability, religion, height, weight, or veteran status in its membership or activities unless permitted by university policy for gender specific organizations. It falls to the Cosine to execute this Article. Article 5: This Constitution may be amended by the Sines. Any Member may propose an amendment’s text. See Article 1 for voting details. Article 6: This Constitution will be MSAIL's supreme law. (Modulo University Policy.) Article 7: This Constitution will be ratified by the Sines. This Constitution will be re-written and ratified at least once in any 1024-day window. See Article 1 for voting details.

This includes technical content, ways to get involved on campus, opportunities for research, jobs, and networking, and other advice regarding involvement in the field.\nWe intend to continually update this page with more resources and will occasionally restructure it to provide better depth.\nLearning Concepts It\u0026rsquo;s important to know that AI is a broad field spanning the past century. We shouldn\u0026rsquo;t simply think of AI as \u0026ldquo;deep learning\u0026rdquo;, because it\u0026rsquo;s not. We\u0026rsquo;re listing resources regarding the most popular topics first because we understand they\u0026rsquo;re likely what initially grabbed your interest, but do note that there\u0026rsquo;s plenty of research being carried out on topics that we\u0026rsquo;ve probably never even heard of.\nSam Finlayson from Harvard/MIT has a fantastic page on resources you can use to dive into ML. It\u0026rsquo;s quite advanced but provides a good starting point for those looking for a comprehensive list. We\u0026rsquo;ll be using some of these resources in our own lists.\nKeep in mind that just because we link a large list doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you should be going through the entire thing. There\u0026rsquo;s way too much stuff to look at. The links within links within links are all meant to provide options; choose a specific topic that interests you (for example, generative models) and slowly explore it.\nIntro to Deep Learning Understanding deep learning to a satisfactory degree requires working familiarity (but not necessarily mastery) with the following prerequisite topics:\n Vector and Matrix Operations Calculus (Partial and total derivatives, gradients) Probability Basic statistics  Check out the slides/recordings from our education sessions, where some of these concepts are explained.\nFor a more thorough introduction to the field, we suggest the following resources:\n  Fast AI\u0026rsquo;s Deep Learning course  EECS 498/598 - Deep Learning for Computer Vision @ University of Michigan  CS231n - Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition @ Stanford University  In particular, the second listed resource (EECS 498/598) is a course offered here every Fall. It is very similar to CS231n, so just one of the two would be satisfactory. These two courses are extremely well designed and we recommend them as a starting point.\nComputer Vision EECS 598 and CS231n (linked above) are a good start for getting involved with vision. These courses are heavily focused on deep learning, so if you want to learn about some of the methods that were popular before deep learning took off, try materials from EECS 442.\n Here\u0026rsquo;s a massive resource list called Awesome Computer Vision\nThe reason we link those courses above is because they cover a good breadth of topics in vision. You will know what you need to in order to make proper searches for your own research and projects once you\u0026rsquo;ve gone through one of them.\nNatural Language Processing NLP also has a few courses worth looking at:\n  CS224n - NLP with Deep Learning @ Stanford University  EECS 598 - NLP with Deep Learning @ University of Michigan  This class was a seminar. It was less focused on educational material and more focused on contemporary research. So scroll this page if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for interesting papers.    Other resources:\n  Awesome NLP  Similar to Awesome CV linked in the previous section, this is a massive list of resources to get acquainted with the field.    NLP Textbook by Jacob Eisenstein  Jay Alammar\u0026rsquo;s Blog  The Annotated Transformer  This is a really nice guide going through a \u0026ldquo;line by line\u0026rdquo; implementation of Attention is All You Need (the seminal transformer paper)    Reinforcement Learning Here are some courses you can look at to learn about reinforcement learning:\n  CS 285 - Deep Reinforcement Learning @ UC Berkeley  CS 234 - Reinforcement Learning @ Stanford University  This links to a series of lecture videos because the course website was taken down for some reason.    Open AI put a ton of effort into creating a comprehensive resource for people to learn RL:\n  Spinning Up in Deep RL  Other resources:\n  Awesome RL  Similar to Awesome CV/NLP linked in the previous sections, this is a massive list of resources to get acquainted with the field.    Resources from DeepMind  Sutton \u0026amp; Barto - Intro to RL Textbook  This is the de facto textbook for people to self-study RL. We can\u0026rsquo;t guarantee that this link will always work, but if it\u0026rsquo;s taken down, \u0026ldquo;Sutton and Barto\u0026rdquo; is all you\u0026rsquo;d need to search up.    Lilian Weng\u0026rsquo;s Lil' Log  Her blog contains more than just RL, but her RL posts are thorough and accessible (provided you have a basic ML background). In general, we really recommend blog posts from professionals because they\u0026rsquo;re easy to read yet rife with information.    Finally, we also have the reinforcement learning theory course (EECS 598) here at Michigan. However, materials aren\u0026rsquo;t posted online and enrollment is, as usual, heavily limited - so we recommend looking at the materials from other courses in the meantime.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re in the process of adding more learning resources!\nCampus involvement Getting involved during your time on campus is the fastest way to learn about AI. You should definitely take relevant courses, but we also recommend joining a research group or relevant team to get more practice and familiarity with relevant topics. This includes participating in MSAIL-sponsored projects. MSAIL has a reading group, but it\u0026rsquo;s hard to balance all the different subfields of AI in just ~15 sessions in a semester. We highly recommend joining reading groups for more depth regarding the topics you\u0026rsquo;re interested in.\nClasses Last updated on 1/2/21. This is a listing of courses related to AI (from a technical perspective) here at the University of Michigan. We tried to be as comprehensive as possible, but there are far too many courses to sift through, so we may have missed some. More information is available on the LSA course guide.\nAs a side note, there are many courses that we can argue are related to AI from a less technical perspective. For example, take classes in the cognitive sciences - the development of human-like AI is heavily motivated by studies in this field. We leave these classes out for brevity\u0026rsquo;s sake.\nUndergraduate-level Classes:\n   Class Code Class Name Last offered?
