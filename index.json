So you get a dataset of driver-view video that you recently collected, hand it off to your labelers, and a month or so later train the model on the labeled data. You get about 90% accuracy on both your train and test sets, and so you push the code to your team’s GitHub, tell your team you have a working algorithm, and celebrate. When the team uses it, however, they make an unpleasant discovery: the algorithm does not detect sidewalks at all! Your troubleshooting brings you to that labeled dataset, and you hang your head in your hands: 90% of the frames in the dataset don’t have sidewalks in them! Instead of learning meaningful decision-making rules, your model has learned to predict that all images do not contain sidewalks.\n Or let’s say you’re working at a security company, and your team is tasked with creating a facial recognition algorithm. You spend a few months labeling a dataset of human faces, where the distribution of ethnicities in the dataset matches the distribution of ethnicities in the United States. According to the US Census from 2010, the dataset will be roughly 75% “white alone” faces and 13% “black or African American” faces (as seen in [1], Tab. P3). Then you tuck the dataset away into some folder somewhere and move on to designing the algorithm. When it comes to test time, your algorithm does significantly worse at recognizing dark-skinned faces. This reflects findings from a paper published in 2018 by Buolamwini and Gebru [2], where three commercial facial recognition algorithms trained on two benchmark datasets consisting of roughly 80% / 85% “white” faces had an astonishing 35% error rate on dark-skinned female faces. The consequences of an algorithm biased like this are not theory; less than an hour away from Ann Arbor, a dark-skinned man in Farmington Hills was wrongfully arrested based on a mistake made by a facial recognition algorithm, forcing him to spend thousands of dollars on an attorney to defend himself for a crime he did not commit [3].\nObama being upsampled into a light-skinned man (The Verge)  In either case, you have a critical failure, and your project manager firmly tells you that the product needs to ship in three weeks. One possible solution is to add more data to “balance out” the different image classes: have your labelers find and label more images with sidewalks, or have them find and label more images of people of color. But labeling the original dataset took months, and with the degree of imbalance that you have, it would take a similar amount of resources to successfully address that. And you only have three weeks! Even if you had more time, how do you tell your boss that you now need the team to spend more resources on more labeling work? If only there was a way that you could have balanced the dataset earlier!\n Both of these are motivating examples for the problem I am working on in my lab, the Data Elements from Video using Impartial Algorithm Tools for Extraction lab at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI-DEVIATE). This is a subproblem we are trying to solve as part of our broader objective to create tools for the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to assist labelers with video data. Specifically in this subproblem, we want to save FHWA labelers time with future research tasks, and we want the models they train to avoid bias. We call this problem the “human sampling problem”.\n Labeling lots of data is costly. Hiring labelers requires money, and those labelers need time to accurately label a dataset. When it comes to a non-trivial image / video labeling task (for example, drawing bounding boxes around cell phones in videos of someone driving a vehicle), you also need to create a rubric so that all of your labelers are on the same page.\n In addition, you may not want to use all that data. If a large dataset is skewed, an algorithm trained on that dataset will in turn be skewed towards making a particular decision. This is the root of both of the failures in the examples presented above – a sidewalk detector trained on skewed data cannot recognize sidewalks, and a facial recognition algorithm trained on skewed data struggles to identify the faces of dark-skinned women.\n Considering both of these problems, one possible remedy would be to sample a subset of your original dataset before handing it over to the labelers such that the subset we select is as informative as possible. We hypothesize that a subset with maximum information will not be skewed, i.e. we think a dataset of 10 cats and 90 dogs will probably have less information than a dataset with 50 cats and 50 dogs. The way we have framed this is that we want to maximize gain in information per unit of cost in terms of labeler time.\n In short, we want to reduce labeling time as much as possible while minimizing loss in accuracy by sampling a subset of our dataset that contains as much information as possible.\n At this point, we are still investigating possible solutions. We are currently testing our ideas on images, with plans to transfer our work to applications on video data. Here’s what we’ve already done and what we’re working on right now:\nSanity checks: We first confirmed that skewed datasets tend to have lower accuracy. Using the Stanford Cars and the FGCV-Aircraft datasets, we looked at samples of 50 of one class versus 150 of the other and compared the results of a model trained on those samples to a model trained on 100 of each. We confirmed that the model trained on the balanced sample tended to outperform the model trained on the skewed samples.\nSome examples from the Stanford Cars dataset  The rest of our techniques essentially attempt to learn some representation of each example image in our dataset, then find a sampling strategy such that the examples we sample into our subset are as dissimilar as possible.\nSSD: We tried using SSD (sum of square differences) as a distance between every pair of images in our dataset and sampling a subset that maximizes the sum of SSDs between images in the dataset. We did not find a correlation between sum of SSDs in a dataset and model accuracy, because SSD does not encode relevant information. Moreover, we would have to solve an NP-hard problem to accurately maximize the sum of SSDs in a sampled subset, making this strategy unviable on large datasets.\nKeypoint/descriptors-based methods: Algorithms like SIFT, SURF, and ORB detect some number of keypoints that describe an image, along with descriptors for each of those keypoints. We first tried getting a single value for each sample image by summing the squared sums of descriptor components, but this did not produce correlations because we lost the spatial information from the keypoints. We are currently using k-means clustering to separate example images into k different image classes determined via unsupervised learning.\nThe scale-invariant feature transform  (SIFT) algorithm in action Edge detection: Edges can imply what content is in an image, and a dataset whose images have varying amounts of horizontal and vertical edges may have more information than a dataset whose images’ horizontal and vertical edges are not as varied. We are currently investigating ways to implement and evaluate this idea.\nUnsupervised feature encoding with neural networks: By having a neural network (possibly sequence model, GAN) attempt to perform a task, it will learn the features of the data it attempts to perform that task on; we can use those learned features to describe our examples. This is likely appropriate to our problem, but we have not started investigating this yet. I personally think that this approach has merit simply because of how much recent work there has been on this subject, but I wonder if using a learning algorithm to address a problem with a learning algorithm may recurse the problem back into the solution.\n For DEVIATE, successfully solving the human sampling problem means we’ll have found a way to reduce labeler workload while also mitigating problems with accuracy and bias that accompany skewed datasets. Our hope is that creating such a tool will let organizations train more effective models with fewer resources, allowing them to invest effort elsewhere in their projects.\n If working on this problem interests you, consider following up with me (musicer@umich.edu) or the advisor for the subteam working on this problem, Dr. Carol Flannagan (cacf@umich.edu).\nCitations: [1]\tU.S. Government, “2010 Census Summary File 1,” U.S. Census Bureau, United States, SF1/10-4 RV, 2010.\n[2] J.

Much of this performance gain has been attributed to two trends in the NLP community, namely the introduction of transformers, and the increase in model size (and consequent need for intense computational power). Capitalizing on these trends, OpenAI recently released a transformer-based model called GPT-3 with 175 billion parameters, that was trained on roughly 500 billion tokens scraped from the internet.

Indeed. MSAIL will maintain a list of Members, defined as participants in at least one major communications channels such as Slack or a mailing list. MSAIL will strive to discuss Machine Learning literature regularly throughout each school year. Upon joining the organization, all members agree not to undermine the purpose or mission of MSAIL. It falls to the Cosine to execute this Article. Article 1: Legislative powers lie in the Sines. The body of Sines possesses complete power: a simple majority of Sines will suffice to amend this Constitution, to appoint a Cosine, to override any decision of the Cosine, or to act in place of the Cosine. Sines who are informed of a decision to be made but offer no prompt response are not counted in the denominator of the \"simple majority\". The Sines will not allow the number of Cosines to fall below 1. By default, the Sines lie dormant and all powers and responsibilities lie with the Cosine. Article 2: Executive powers lie in the Cosine. Specifically, the Cosine is responsible for the day-to-day functioning of MSAIL, and to that end may act and delegate arbitrarily within Constitutional bounds. It is traditional for the Cosine to distribute significant short-term tasks among the Sines. The Cosine will report to the Sines, and the Sines will vote promptly on presented issues. The Cosine may appoint new Sines with the advice and consent of the old Sines. The Cosine will not allow the number of Sines to fall below 3. The Cosine shall break ties among the Sines. The Cosine may be a Sine. Article 3: MSAIL may also have Faculty Mentors. A faculty mentor can help us just by association. MSAIL may mention their names on its official communications. MSAIL shall inform each Faculty Mentor of its activities via brief weekly emails with no reply needed. Faculty mentors can point us to literature. Faculty mentors are always welcome to share cool papers. MSAIL may also request recommendations within a specific topic. A Faculty Mentor need not take on additional responsibilities, but may choose to do so if requested. The Sines and Cosine will endeavor to use Faculty Mentors’ time effectively. Faculty Mentors need not make any administrative decisions. Faculty Mentors are always welcome but never obliged to attend MSAIL meetings. Article 4: MSAIL is committed to inclusivity and transparency. MSAIL will not discriminate based on academic affiliation(s) or lack thereof, age, breastfeeding or lack thereof, career status, color, criminal record, disability or lack thereof, ethnicity, employment status, gender expression, gender identity, HIV status, marital status, national origin, parental status, personal association, physical features such as height and weight, political activity, pregnancy or lack thereof, race, religion or lack thereof, sex, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background, or veteran status. MSAIL will, moreover, actively include members, no matter the properties listed above. The creation and maintenance of an inclusive environment touches all aspects of our activities, from communications to recruitment and from discussion topics to leadership positions. MSAIL’s motto will be \"the more, the merrier\"; a corollary is that information such as planning discussions will be available to all members, so long as it does not conflict with privacy concerns. To rephrase a subset of the above in a university-required formula: MSAIL is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for all persons and does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, age, marital status, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, disability, religion, height, weight, or veteran status in its membership or activities unless permitted by university policy for gender specific organizations. It falls to the Cosine to execute this Article. Article 5: This Constitution may be amended by the Sines. Any Member may propose an amendment’s text. See Article 1 for voting details. Article 6: This Constitution will be MSAIL's supreme law. (Modulo University Policy.) Article 7: This Constitution will be ratified by the Sines. This Constitution will be re-written and ratified at least once in any 1024-day window. See Article 1 for voting details.

This includes technical content, ways to get involved on campus, opportunities for research, jobs, and networking, and other advice regarding involvement in the field.\nWe intend to continually update this page with more resources and will occasionally restructure it to provide better depth.\nLearning Concepts It\u0026rsquo;s important to know that AI is a broad field spanning the past century. We shouldn\u0026rsquo;t simply think of AI as \u0026ldquo;deep learning\u0026rdquo;, because it\u0026rsquo;s not. We\u0026rsquo;re listing resources regarding the most popular topics first because we understand they\u0026rsquo;re likely what initially grabbed your interest, but do note that there\u0026rsquo;s plenty of research being carried out on topics that we\u0026rsquo;ve probably never even heard of.\nSam Finlayson from Harvard/MIT has a fantastic page on resources you can use to dive into ML. It\u0026rsquo;s quite advanced but provides a good starting point for those looking for a comprehensive list. We\u0026rsquo;ll be using some of these resources in our own lists.\nKeep in mind that just because we link a large list doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you should be going through the entire thing. There\u0026rsquo;s way too much stuff to look at. The links within links within links are all meant to provide options; choose a specific topic that interests you (for example, generative models) and slowly explore it.\nIntro to Deep Learning Understanding deep learning to a satisfactory degree requires working familiarity (but not necessarily mastery) with the following prerequisite topics:\n Vector and Matrix Operations Calculus (Partial and total derivatives, gradients) Probability Basic statistics  Check out the slides/recordings from our education sessions, where some of these concepts are explained.\nFor a more thorough introduction to the field, we suggest the following resources:\n  Fast AI\u0026rsquo;s Deep Learning course  EECS 498/598 - Deep Learning for Computer Vision @ University of Michigan  CS231n - Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition @ Stanford University  In particular, the second listed resource (EECS 498/598) is a course offered here every Fall. It is very similar to CS231n, so just one of the two would be satisfactory. These two courses are extremely well designed and we recommend them as a starting point.\nComputer Vision EECS 598 and CS231n (linked above) are a good start for getting involved with vision. These courses are heavily focused on deep learning, so if you want to learn about some of the methods that were popular before deep learning took off, try materials from EECS 442.\n Here\u0026rsquo;s a massive resource list called Awesome Computer Vision\nThe reason we link those courses above is because they cover a good breadth of topics in vision. You will know what you need to in order to make proper searches for your own research and projects once you\u0026rsquo;ve gone through one of them.\nNatural Language Processing NLP also has a few courses worth looking at:\n  CS224n - NLP with Deep Learning @ Stanford University  EECS 598 - NLP with Deep Learning @ University of Michigan  This class was a seminar. It was less focused on educational material and more focused on contemporary research. So scroll this page if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for interesting papers.    Other resources:\n  Awesome NLP  Similar to Awesome CV linked in the previous section, this is a massive list of resources to get acquainted with the field.    NLP Textbook by Jacob Eisenstein  Jay Alammar\u0026rsquo;s Blog  The Annotated Transformer  This is a really nice guide going through a \u0026ldquo;line by line\u0026rdquo; implementation of Attention is All You Need (the seminal transformer paper)    Reinforcement Learning Here are some courses you can look at to learn about reinforcement learning:\n  CS 285 - Deep Reinforcement Learning @ UC Berkeley  CS 234 - Reinforcement Learning @ Stanford University  This links to a series of lecture videos because the course website was taken down for some reason.    Open AI put a ton of effort into creating a comprehensive resource for people to learn RL:\n  Spinning Up in Deep RL  Other resources:\n  Awesome RL  Similar to Awesome CV/NLP linked in the previous sections, this is a massive list of resources to get acquainted with the field.    Resources from DeepMind  Sutton \u0026amp; Barto - Intro to RL Textbook  This is the de facto textbook for people to self-study RL. We can\u0026rsquo;t guarantee that this link will always work, but if it\u0026rsquo;s taken down, \u0026ldquo;Sutton and Barto\u0026rdquo; is all you\u0026rsquo;d need to search up.    Lilian Weng\u0026rsquo;s Lil' Log  Her blog contains more than just RL, but her RL posts are thorough and accessible (provided you have a basic ML background). In general, we really recommend blog posts from professionals because they\u0026rsquo;re easy to read yet rife with information.    Finally, we also have the reinforcement learning theory course (EECS 598) here at Michigan. However, materials aren\u0026rsquo;t posted online and enrollment is, as usual, heavily limited - so we recommend looking at the materials from other courses in the meantime.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re in the process of adding more learning resources!\nCampus involvement Getting involved during your time on campus is the fastest way to learn about AI. You should definitely take relevant courses, but we also recommend joining a research group or relevant team to get more practice and familiarity with relevant topics. This includes participating in MSAIL-sponsored projects. MSAIL has a reading group, but it\u0026rsquo;s hard to balance all the different subfields of AI in just ~15 sessions in a semester. We highly recommend joining reading groups for more depth regarding the topics you\u0026rsquo;re interested in.\nClasses Last updated on 1/2/21. This is a listing of courses related to AI (from a technical perspective) here at the University of Michigan. We tried to be as comprehensive as possible, but there are far too many courses to sift through, so we may have missed some. More information is available on the LSA course guide.\nAs a side note, there are many courses that we can argue are related to AI from a less technical perspective. For example, take classes in the cognitive sciences - the development of human-like AI is heavily motivated by studies in this field. We leave these classes out for brevity\u0026rsquo;s sake.\nUndergraduate-level Classes:\n   Class Code Class Name Last offered?
