                <h2>MSAIL: Reading Group</h2>
                <h3>Tuesday, 6:00pm in BBB 3725</h3>
                <p>
                    Learn how machines learn!  Each week, a member presents a
                    talk, tutorial or demonstration on a particular field
                    related to machine learning. Usually, the topics for these
                    talks are decided upto 2 weeks in advance and often include
                    subfields that intersect with the presenter's current
                    research or just coincide with their interests. In the past, we have had many members of Michigan's faculty come and deliver a presentation or engage in a discussion about their field of research (<a href="https://michiganross.umich.edu/faculty-research/faculty/eric-schwartz">Professor Eric Schwartz</a> for example, presented a very interesting talk on customer analytics). Normally, meetings consist of a 40-50 minute presentation by the speaker followed by a discussion of the material and Q&amp;A. Organized by <strong>Sam Tenka</strong> and <strong>Tejas Prahlad</strong>. </p>
                
                <h2> MSAIL: Reading Group</h2>
                <h3>Tuesday, 7:00pm in EECS 3725</h3>
                <p>Read and discuss machine learning papers with other students from all across campus! We strive to help students understand topics in machine learning beyond the scope of an introductory course so this is perfect for those who love a deep dive into the field.  Our readings will usually be focused on research papers that are either fundamental in some way to the field of machine learning or that explore the deeper connections between seemingly disparate subfields. Together, we will all work hard to learn new material, drawing examples and applications from the experiences of our members. Meetings consist of a presentation/overview of the week's reading followed by a 30-40 minute group discussion about its underpinnings and possible applications. Organized by <strong>Sam Tenka</strong> and <strong>Tejas Prahlad</strong>. <u>These meetings were not held this past semester but we hope to bring them back!</u></p>
                
                <h2>Michigan Data Science Team</h2>
                <h3>Thursday, 6:00pm in DOW 1013</h3>
                <p>Work on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> competitions and more interestingly, amazing humanitarian <a href="https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/mdst-project/home?authuser=0">data science projects</a> with the first competitive university team in the country. Organized by <a href="http://www.computervision.pro/">Jonathan Stroud</a> and advised by Professors Eric Schwartz, <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~wiensj/">Jenna Wiens</a> and <a href="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~dkoutra/">Danai Koutra</a> (formerly by, <a href="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~jabernet/">Professor Jacob Abernethy</a>), students and researchers alike get to solve real world problems using data science (such as the <a href="http://www.mywater-flint.com/">Flint Water Crisis project</a>) as well as compete against professional data scientists from around the world in fun prediction challenges. You will read papers to learn cutting-edge ML techniques used to solve problems in domains outside of Computer Science, while collaborating with others doing the same and learning a lot along the way! Visit the Michigan Data Science Team (MDST) at <a href="http://mdst.eecs.umich.edu/">mdst.eecs.umich.edu</a> for more information. You can find meeting times either there, or on our <a href="http://mdst.eecs.umich.edu/calendar/">schedule page</a>.</p>
